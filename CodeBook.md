#CodeBook

This CodeBook described the metadata and variables used for reading data , merging and cleaning data and for generating a new tidy dataset (file)

##Input Dataset and Files

The source dataset for this project is downloaded from 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

####Input files
The [file](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded, unzipped and stored in working directory as

| Variable | Value | Description|
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| destinationfilename|UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip| File downlaoded stored as "UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip" |

The above file is then unzipped to read the "test" and "train" data files

| Variable | Value | Description|
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
|trainfile|UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt|Training Set|
|trainsubjectfile|UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt|Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.|
|trainactfile|UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt|Training labels|
|testfile|UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt|Training Set|
|testsubjectfile|UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt|Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.|
|testactfile|UCI HAR Dataset//test/y_test.txt|Test labels|
|featuresfile|UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt|List of all features|
|activitylabelfile|UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt|Links the class labels with their activity name|

##Transformations 

####Part 1
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

| Variable | Description|
| ------ | ----------- |
|dfXtrain| Dataframe from "X_train.txt" file|
|dftrainsubject| Dataframe from "subject_train.txt" file|
|dftrainactivity| Dataframe from "y_train.txt" file|
|dfXtest| Dataframe from "X_test.txt" file|
|dftestsubject| Dataframe from "subject_test.txt" file|
|dftestactivity| Dataframe from "y_test.txt" file|
|traindataset| Combined "Train" dataset with data from dfXtrain,dftrainsubject and dftrainactivity dataframes (using "cbind")|
|testdataset| Combined "Test" dataset with data from dfXtest,dftestsubject and dftestactivity dataframes (using "cbind")|
|combineddataset| Train and Test records merged into this dataset using "rbind"|
|dffeatures|Contains data from "features.txt"|
|features|Charachter vector created by reading second column of "dffeatures". This is used to set columnnames of the "combineddataset"|

####Part 2
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

| Variable | Description|
| ------ | ----------- |
|meanandstdcol| Contains the columns that matched grep("mean|std", features, ignore.case = TRUE)|
|meanandstddata| Mean and Std columns extracted into this dataset from "combineddataset"|
|extractedData| Dataframe with data from "meanandstddata", Subjects and Actvity columns from "combineddataset"|

####Part 3
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

| Variable | Description|
| ------ | ----------- |
|dfactivitylabel| Dataframe from "activity_lables.txt". Replace "_" with " " to make activity names user friendly|

Join "extraxtedData" on Activity ID with "dfactivitylabel" replacing Activity ID by corresponding label

####Part 4
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

The following have been replaced by using the "gsub" command
* Columns starting with "t" to "Time"
* Columns starting with "f" to "Frequency"
* Replace "-mean()" with "Mean"
* Replace ".std" with "STD"
* Replace "Acc" with "Accelerometer"
* Replace "Mag" to "Magnitude"
* Replace "-freq()" to "Frequency"
* Replace "angle" withe "Angle"
* Replace "gravity" with "Gravity"
* Replace "tBody" with "TimeBody"
* Replace "BodyBody" with "Body"

####Part 5
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
The following library is used for faster calculation of mean by "Subject" and "Activity" on "extractedData" from Part 4
```
library(data.table)
extractedData <- data.table(extractedData)
```
| Variable | Description|
| ------ | ----------- |
|tidydata| Dataset containing mean of each column by "Subject" and "Activity"|

"TidyDataSet.txt" is the Output file.

##Output

The following file is generated by "run_analysis.R" 

* TidyDataSet.txt - Tidy dataset with means of measurements by Subject and Activity. The file contains 88 columns and has 180 observations

Here are the columns in the TidyDataSet.txt File

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ------------|
| Subject | An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment|
| Activity| Activity performed by the "Subject" during experiments. See Activities list below|
| TimeBodyAccelerometerMean()-X | Mean (by Subject and Activity) of TimeBodyAccelerometerMean()-X |
| TimeBodyAccelerometerMean()-Y | Mean (by Subject and Activity) of TimeBodyAccelerometerMean()-Y |
| TimeBodyAccelerometerMean()-Z | Mean (by Subject and Activity) of TimeBodyAccelerometerMean()-Z|
| TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD()-X | Mean(by Subject and Activity) of TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD()-X|
| TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD()-Y | Mean(by Subject and Activity) of TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD()-Y|
| TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD()-Z | Mean(by Subject and Activity) of TimeBodyAccelerometerSTD()-Z|
